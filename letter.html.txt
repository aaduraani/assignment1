<h1>Re: Your application to join the University of Awesome</h1>

<p>Dear Eileen,</p>

<p>Thank you for sending your application to join the science faculty at the University of Awesome for your <abbr title="Doctor of Philosophy">PhD</abbr> studies next year. I’m happy to answer your questions below, one at a time.</p>

<h2>Start Dates</h2>

<p>We’re flexible with your start date, but ideally, it would be easier if you began at the start of a semester. Here are the official start dates:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First semester: 9 September 2016</li>
  <li>Second semester: 15 January 2017</li>
  <li>Third semester: 2 May 2017</li>
</ul>

<p>Please let me know if any of these work for you, and which one you prefer.</p>

<h2>Research Areas</h2>

<p>Our faculty encourages a broad range of research topics as long as they fit within science and technology. You come across as a smart and committed researcher — exactly who we want here. Among your ideas, these caught our interest most, although we liked the rest too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Transforming H<sub>2</sub>O into wine and exploring the health benefits of Resveratrol (C<sub>14</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>3</sub>).</li>
  <li>Studying how funk bass players perform at temperatures above 30°C (86°F), especially as audience size grows dramatically (from 10<sup>3</sup> to 10<sup>4</sup>).</li>
  <li><abbr title="British Columbia">BC</abbr> nanoparticle accelerators designed for fissionable nanomaterials (unrelated to the Manhattan Project).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unusual Dance Studies</h2>

<p>You asked about exotic dance moves. Yes, I did some postdoctoral work researching tribal dances. Here are a few of my favorites, with brief explanations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Polynesian chicken dance: An influential dance dating back to around 300<sup>BC</sup>.</li>
  <li>Icelandic brownian shuffle: A warming dance practiced before fire was common in Iceland.</li>
  <li>Arctic robot dance: A unique blend of Inuit drumming and funk robot moves.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sincerely,<br>
